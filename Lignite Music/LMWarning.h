/**
 The warning priority tells the system how important this warning is. The system will handle the chance that the warning gets displayed based on its priority, with severe being crucial.

 - LMWarningPriorityLow: The priority is low, this is more of an "in case you wanted to know" warning. Colour will be a very light grey.
 - LMWarningPriorityHigh: The priority is high, this is handy for when user input is required (but not absolutely necessary). Colour will be Lignite Red.
 - LMWarningPrioritySevere: The priority is severe and the app is having trouble handling its emotions without the user's input. This priority is twice as large as a normal warning and is always Lignite Red.
