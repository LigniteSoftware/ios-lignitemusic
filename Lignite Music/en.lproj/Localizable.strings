 Hello, and thanks for translating Lignite Music!
 
 Please read the following notes *thoroughly*.
 
 1. The following characters in between quotes must be left in exact format and must not be deleted, changed or 
 modified in any other way:
	"\n", "%02i", "%d", "%lu", "%@", "%%", "%f", "%.02f", "%.03f"
 Any string in the above list with a percentage (%) symbol I will now reference as "formatters".
 
 2. Any character mentioned in point 1 that is in a string will have data injected into it. If there are more than
 one formatter, that means that data is inserted in that order. When you change strings with formatters, please do not
 change the order of the formatters or remove formatters. The order of which the data is inserted into these strings is 
 static. If your language *absolutely requires* a different order, please contact us directly.
 
 3. If you are confused about a string, look at its key first. It may help clarify. 
 If still you have any questions about translating Lignite Music please let us know. You should not feel uncertain 
 what a strinhg is doing, and if you are, just let us know and we'll clarify. Now that you've read this far, 
 please send us a picture of a walrus so we know you did. Yes, seriously.
 
 4. The following words/terms should *never* be translated into your language for legal reasons:
	"Lignite Music", "Lignite", "Pebble", "Apple Music", "Spotify"
 
 Thanks, and have fun!

 Image Management
 ----------------
 Lignite Music automatically downloads images from last.fm to ensure maximum visual quality. However, this can take up a signifigant amount of space or cellular data, so we ensure that users know what we are doing and allow us to do it should they be low on storage or on cellular data. They can always change their decision in settings.

 Music Collection Types
 ----------------------
 Music collection types are what shows for sources, for example, a list of sources (Albums, Titles, Composers, etc.)

 Onboarding
 ----------
 Onboarding is the first thing that a user who just installed the app sees. To give you an idea, the slides go as follow:
 
 1. Welcome
 2. Setup music permission
 2.1. If the user denies the music permission, we see force them to accept it (otherwise the app is useless) in an external screen
 3. Setup Bluetooth permission
 3.1. This is optional so we do not force it
 4. Tutorial
 4.1. If user views tutorial, it goes to the tutorial
 4.2. Otherwise they can skip it and it will go to the next slide
 5. Thank you screen/end of onboarding
